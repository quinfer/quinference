I am a passionate lecturer who encourages active learning using a growth mindset. My teaching philosophy fosters confident humility and cultivates curiousity. I research to feed my own curiousity and build confident humilty, advocating the responsible using of cutting edge statistics. My research interests include computer age statistical inference, Responsible AI, banking, and association football. I founded and provides oversight for the Queen's Student Managed fund. I run the masters in quantitative finance, and teaches graduate-level statistics for time series and algorithmic trading and investment. I have extensive statistical consulting and professional training experience and have worked with local companies to build high-performance statistical forecasting infrastructure. Finally, I built and maintain a high-performance cloud computing resource for teaching  in the Management School.  This resources using [RStudio Professional](https://www.rstudio.com/products/team/) products so that student can learn how to produce interoperable, agile, literate, credible, and reproducible digital solutions to modern business/finance anayltic challenges.
